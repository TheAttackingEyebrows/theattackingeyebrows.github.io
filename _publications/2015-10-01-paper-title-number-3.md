excerpt: 'This manuscript describes a method for reconstructing 3D anatomical shapes from a single XR, named MISNeX. MISNeX extends the work of previous chapters by leveraging a contrastive learning framework to overcome the inherent limitations of 2D input, enabling the reconstruction of complex 3D shapes without requiring volumetric data. The method directly regresses an implicit function from a 2D XR image to represent the surface of an anatomical structure. Unlike conventional methods that rely on template mesh deformation or CT reconstruction from XR images, MISNeX avoids the topological constraints of template mesh deformation and the inaccuracies often introduced by CT reconstruction. By embedding 3D spatial information into the 2D latent features through contrastive learning, MISNeX enables high-quality 3D shape reconstructions, even for complex anatomical structures like the pelvis. The method was evaluated using publicly available femur and pelvis datasets, where it achieved superior results compared to state-of-the-art template mesh deformation and implicit shape representation method using 2D input, and achieved comparable results with implicit shape representation method using 3D input.'
