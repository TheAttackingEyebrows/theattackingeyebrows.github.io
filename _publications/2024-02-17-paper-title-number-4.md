excerpt: 'Mesh representation of medical imaging isosurfaces are essential for medical analysis. These representations are typically obtained using mesh extraction methods to segment 3D volumes. However, the meshes extracted from such methods often suffer from undesired staircase artefacts. In this paper, we evaluate the existing mesh deformation methods that deform a template mesh to desired shapes. We evaluate two variants of such method on three datasets of varying topological complexity. Our objective is to demonstrate that, despite the mesh deformation methods having their limitations, they avoid the generation of staircase artefacts.'
