I am currently working as an Applied Scientist at Oracle Health and AI, where I focus on developing advanced machine learning and language models to support healthcare applications.

I received my Bachelor of Information Technology degree with First Class Honours from the University of Sydney in 2019. I recently completed my PhD at the School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, under the supervision of Prof. Jinman Kim and Prof. Lei Bi. During my doctoral studies, I also served as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Lei Bi.

My research interests include medical image visualization, mixed reality, and augmented reality. My projects center on integrating deep learning technologies to modernize medical image visualization pipelines, enhancing interactivity, accessibility, and visual fidelity for clinical and research use.
