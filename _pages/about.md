I received my BIT degree at the University of Sydney in 2019 with first class Honours. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree at the School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, supervised by Prof. Jinman Kim, and Prof. Lei Bi. Recently, I also attended the Institue of Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, as a visiting scholar, supervised by Prof. Lei Bi.

My research interests include medical image visualisation, mixed reality, augmented reality. My projects focus on integrating deep learning technologies to modernise the medical image visualisation pipelines in terms of better interactivity, accessibility and visual quality.
